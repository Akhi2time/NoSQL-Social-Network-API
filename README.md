# NoSQL-Social-Network-API

My goal for this challenge was to build an API for for our social network web-application. This platform we can share thoughts, create a friend-list and deletle friends, react to friends. We used Express.js. MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.We used express.js and Mongoose packages, we did have the option to use JavaSrcirpt Date to formate timestamps and date our library.
I learned how to use MongoDB syntax by practicing creating models, routes, and controllers. One specific syntax i used was the findOneAndUpdate for my controllers. I also got a little bit more experience using Insomnia using the post,get,delete.
